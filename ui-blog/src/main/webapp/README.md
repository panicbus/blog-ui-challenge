#####Challenge tested in:

- Chrome

- Firefox

#####Libraries used:

- jQuery: Coding wouldn't be the same without it!

- Handlebars: Used because of how easy it makes templating and formatting data for use anywhere in the DOM.

- Bootstrap: Used for the responsive grid system and standarized styling of page elements.

#####Source Code Files:

- main.html: Used to keep all the UI elements and Single Page App stuff. View Post and the Edit Post form are kept on this page. All the Handlebars scripts and templates are kept here too.

- new-post.html: I thought keeping the "add new post" page seperated from the rest allows for a more intuitive user experience.

- js/application.js: Used for all the Ajax and page refresh stuff.

- css/application.css: For styling obviously.

#####Test Elements
 Six out of seven test elements are completed.

 The user can:

 - See the landing page where they can find the list of all their posts. The post list is updated dynamically.

 - Create a new blog post

 - View and individual post by clicking the title in the post list.

 - Edit any post directly from the page.

 - Delete any post directly from the page.

 I ran out of time to add delete all posts. One more hour would have been sufficient probably.
